# 1. Basic Types - (integer, float, complex, boolean & strings)
# 2. Containers Types - (List, Tuples, sets & dictionary)
# 3. User-defined Types - Class



# Identifiers - a python identifiers is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
# Rules for settings identifiers
# 1. can only start with an alphabet or _
# 2. followed by 0 or more letter, _ and digits
# 3. keywords can not be used as an identifiers


# keywords - a word that is reserved by a program because the word has a special meaning. keywords can be commands or parameters. we can not used these words as a variable name.


# print(3+3.3)

# type conversion is not a permanent operation but type casting is the permanent operation
